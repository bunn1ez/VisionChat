# Usage Instructions for VisionChat

## 1. Setting Environment Variables

### Mac/Linux
Use the `export` command in the terminal to set environment variables.
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
Windows
Command Prompt

sh
Copy code
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
PowerShell

powershell
Copy code
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
2. Changing Executable Permissions
Before running the install_dependencies.sh script on Mac/Linux, you need to ensure it has the correct permissions to execute.

sh
Copy code
chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
3. Installing Dependencies
Run the installation script to set up the necessary dependencies.

With sudo (Mac/Linux)
sh
Copy code
sudo ./install_dependencies.sh
4. Running the Python Script
Once the environment variable is set and the dependencies are installed, navigate to the directory containing your Python script (visionchat.py) in your terminal or command prompt.

Run the script using the following command:

sh
Copy code
python3 visionchat.py
On Windows, you might use python instead of python3 if that's the command configured for Python 3.

After running the command, follow the interactive prompts to input the image path and output file name. The script will perform OCR, extract questions, get answers from GPT-3, and write the results to the specified output file.
